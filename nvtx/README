This directory has MPI wrappers that are instrumented with nvtx
markers.  The idea is to preload the wrapper library for use with
NVIDIA's profiling tools, thus making MPI calls visible in NVIDIA's
tools for visual timeline analysis.  The MPI wrappers also provide
controls for cudaProfilerStart()/cudaProfilerStop(), including support
for time-window profiling.  This makes it possible to selectively
profile a time-window without instrumenting the code.

Requirements : CUDA, mpicc with gcc as the underlying compiler

===============================================================================
Build/Install :

  (1) ./configure --with-cuda=/path/to/cuda
  (2) make libmpitrace.so   

===============================================================================
Typical use :

  (1) export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libmpitrace.so
  (2) mpirun -np 1024 ./helper.sh your.exe ...
      where the helper.sh script turns on nvprof for a selected rank
  (3) unset LD_PRELOAD

NVIDIA's nvprof is a very powerful tool for analysis of GPU performance,
but it can be invasive in the context of tightly-coupled MPI parallel
applications.  Instead of launching one instance of nvprof for every
MPI rank, there will be less disruption if nvprof is used selectively
for one specified rank, and a helper script can be used for that.  An
example of a helper script is shown below for openmpi :

#!/bin/bash
if [ $OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK = 31 ]; then
  if [ -f nvp.dat ]; then
    mv nvp.dat nvp.dat.bak
  fi
  /usr/local/cuda/bin/nvprof --export-profile nvp.dat "$@"
else
 exec "$@"
fi

In this example, nvprof is turned on for MPI rank 31, and profile data
is saved in a file "nvp.dat", with a backup made for any pre-existing
"nvp.dat" file.  One could be more specific about naming the nvprof
output, using for example a timestamp or a jobid.

With nvprof it can be advantageous to limit profiling to a specific code
block using cudaProfilerStart()/cudaProfilerStop() or to a specified time
window.  The following illustrates the time-window profiling method, 
where the intent is to capture nvprof data for MPI rank 31 with a start
time of 40 seconds after MPI_Init() and a stop time of 45 seconds after
MPI_Init() :

Job script :
  export PROFILE_BEGIN_TIME=40
  export PROFILE_END_TIME=45
  export PROFILE_RANK=31
  export SAVE_LIST=$PROFILE_RANK
  export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/nvtx/libmpitrace.so
  mpirun -np 128 ./helper.sh your.exe [args]

Helper script :
#!/bin/bash
if [ $OMPI_COMM_WORLD_RANK = $PROFILE_RANK ]; then
  if [ -f nvp.dat ]; then
    mv nvp.dat nvp.dat.bak
  fi
  /usr/local/cuda/bin/nvprof --profile-from-start off --export-profile nvp.dat "$@"
else
 exec "$@"
fi

With the time-window profiling method, it is not necessary to instrument
the code with calls to cudaProfilerStart()/cudaProfilerStop(), and in 
in fact source code access is not required at all.  The libmpitrace.so 
library can track the time that has elapsed after MPI_Init() when every 
MPI function is called, and start and stop CUDA profiling as directed
via environment variables.
